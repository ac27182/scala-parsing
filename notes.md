# notes

- 'the expression problem'
- type class components
  - the signature
  - the Implementations for supported types
  - a function the requires a type class
- 'implicits' are confusing
  - the last parameter list in a scala function can be marked as implicit
  - implicit parameters are filled in by the compiler
  - you can specify an implicit explicitly
  - they are used to require evidence of the compiler
  - like the existance of a type class in scope
- type safe equality
- use implicit not found annotation
- think more about annotations...
- type ascription
- \_\* is a special instance of type ascryption
